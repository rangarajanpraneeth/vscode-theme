~~The theme is still a work in progress, and you may notice that some (most actually) tokens aren't yet colored.~~

I fixed everything.

~~Feel free to modify this theme to your liking, or fix what I was too lazy to finish. If you do fix it, open up a pull request so I can benefit from the fruits of your labor.~~

Now you can enjoy the fruits of my labor.

NOTE: You don't need the settings.json anymore if you don't want, since custom syntax highlighting no longer resides there. Just drop in theme.json into whatever theme you installed and it should work.
